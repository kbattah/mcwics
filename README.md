# Spotted for McWics Hackathon 2021

Spotted is a fun, interactive Python application that generates playful and light-hearted roasts based on a user's Spotify rewind playlist. It analyzes users' top tracks to craft unique roasts about their favorite artist, preferred music era, and overall mood of the songs they listen to. Submitted to my first ever hackathon in 2021!
